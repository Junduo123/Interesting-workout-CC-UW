## Introduction
CouchDB is a popular document-type database. Since it uses the http protocol and JSON for communications,
libraries are easy to create for various programming environments. In this assignment, you will use Python to demonstrate access to a CouchDB database. You will be implementing a simple contact list.

## Requirements
- `1.`: As the Python program starts, the user is asked for
        - `a.` The CouchDB URL
        - `b.` The CouchDB administrator id
        - `c.` The CouchDB administrator password
        - `d.` The Database to use for the Contact system
